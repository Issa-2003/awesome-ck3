## Software and applications

Useful tools and applications for modding or mod management.

### Mod management

- [Irony Mod Manager](https://github.com/bcssov/IronyModManager): an alternative to the official Paradox Launcher. Doesn't support mod analysis yet, but it's on the roadmap. **Warning:** Use one or the other to avoid conflicts

### Graphical modding

- [Mayan and Photoshop exporters](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Exporters): exporter tools that Paradox provides 'as-is'. These can be used to export textures from Photoshop and meshes/animations from Maya. More documentation can be found on the [Stellaris wiki](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Maya_exporter)
- [Mesh editor for Blender and Maya](https://github.com/ross-g/io_pdx_mesh): allow editing of mesh and animation files used in the various Clausewitz Engine games in both Maya and Blender

### Other Tools

- [CWTools](https://cwtools.github.io): a syntax analysis tool that can be used in IDE (VSCode) or some custom projects (used in Irony Mod Manager for example)
- [PDX Unlimiter](https://github.com/crschnick/pdx_unlimiter): a save editing software for Paradox games. Raw CK3 save editing is supported though advanced and more fancy editing GUI tools are still to come

## Communities
